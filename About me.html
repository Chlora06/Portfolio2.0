        My name is Zaijing Liu, and I am passionate about creating meaningful, user-centered experiences through UX and interaction design. With a major in Computer Science and a minor in Design, I have developed a strong technical foundation that allows me to bring innovative design ideas to life.

        I am particularly drawn to equity-focused and human-centric design, as I believe that design should be inclusive and accessible to all users. I am committed to understanding diverse user needs, designing solutions that promote equality, and ensuring that each interaction feels intuitive and engaging. My goal is to craft experiences that not only meet users' needs but also foster a sense of connection and empowerment.

        I am excited to bring my skills and my passion for user experience to a team that values empathy and innovation in design.

      <h1>Education</h1>
      <p>
        Currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in Visual Communication Design at San Francisco State University, I am set to graduate in May 2025 with a GPA of 3.8. My academic background combines technical proficiency with a strong foundation in design principles. Additionally, I have completed the Google UX Design Certification, where I gained hands-on experience in key areas such as user research, wireframing, prototyping, usability testing, and creating accessible, user-centered products. This blend of skills and experience has prepared me to approach design challenges with both a technical and user-centric mindset.

      <h1>Design experiences</h1>
      <p>
        With a background in Computer Science and Visual Communication Design, I have built a solid understanding of both technical and design principles to create user-centered experiences. My hands-on projects include TravelWise, a travel website that helps users discover destinations, post to find travel companions, and uses AI to identify locations within images. Additionally, I have designed UX prototypes in Figma, such as a plant care app with AR diagnosis features and a pet adoption platform that supports both adoption and fostering. Through these projects, I have honed my skills in wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing, consistently prioritizing equity-focused and human-centric design principles. Each project has deepened my commitment to creating accessible, engaging, and intuitive experiences that resonate with diverse users.

      <h1>Interests</h1>
      <p>
        One of my main interests is anime and cosplay. I love attending conventions, where I can express myself through various gothic and Lolita-inspired outfits. Through anime, I have learned about the structure of hero stories and developed an appreciation for diverse visual styles, which has enhanced my understanding of how to convey ideas through different aesthetics. Cosplaying and participating in conventions allow me to relax, find like-minded friends, and embrace my creativity. Wearing gothic and Lolita fashion gives me a boost of confidence and joy, allowing me to explore new dimensions of self-expression.

        Another passion of mine is photography. I've had a Canon 200D Mark II since high school, and it has been my faithful companion over the many years since. Over time, I've invested in various lenses to capture different perspectives. Landscape photography, in particular, brings me a sense of calm and allows me to preserve fleeting moments in a unique way. I also enjoy color grading my photos, which lets me experiment with different styles and moods, adding an extra layer of creativity to my work. For me, photography is not just a hobby but a way to experience and share the beauty of each moment.
